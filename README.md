# Quantum Virtual Mind (QVM) Workflow

This repository contains the end-to-end workflow for implementing the toy model of Quantum Virtual Mind (QVM), a novel computational framework designed to simulate human cognitive processes using quantum mechanics and graph gauge theory.

## Overview

The QVM framework integrates classical and quantum algorithms to model the brain's connectome and simulate cognitive dynamics. The workflow is divided into four primary phases:
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**
2. **Calibration of the QVM**
3. **Quantum Simulation of the QVM**
4. **Building the Agentome**

## Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- **Data Sources**:
  - **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**: Real-time brain wave data collection via EEG and other neural recording systems.
  - **Personal Omics Data**: Integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets.

- **Processing Steps**:
  - Brain wave data is preprocessed using Large Mental Models (LMM) for alignment with cognitive states.
  - Personal omics data is analyzed with Large Omics Models (LOM) to capture underlying molecular mechanisms.

- **Key Outputs**:
  - Cleaned, harmonized data ready for quantum connectome calibration.

### 2. Calibration of the QVM
- **Purpose**: Personalize a generic quantum connectome model to reflect the individualâ€™s neural architecture.
- **Steps**:
  - Characterize the connectome using eigenvalues and harmonics.
  - Expand the connectome through perturbations based on BCI and omics data.
- **Output**: A calibrated QVM connectome representing the individual's neural dynamics.

### 3. Quantum Simulation of the QVM
- **Purpose**: Simulate neural activity and cognitive processes.
- **Steps**:
  - Construct a Hamiltonian from the calibrated connectome.
  - Perform quantum simulations to analyze thought propagation and compute Mental Stress Tensors (MST).
- **Output**: Temporal and spatial dynamics of mental states.

### 4. Building the Agentome
- **Purpose**: Create a personalized multi-agent AI system that models cognitive components of the human mind.
- **Steps**:
  - Derive Mental Stress Tensors to quantify cognitive and emotional states.
  - Build agents representing Ego, Intellect, Memory, Sensory, and Action.
- **Applications**:
  - Personalized mental health interventions.
  - Real-time adaptation for mindfulness practices.

## Features

- **Quantum Modeling**:
  - Leverages U(1) graph gauge theory to represent neural interactions.
  - Hamiltonian-based simulations for understanding cognitive states.

- **Data Integration**:
  - Combines real-time BCI data with omics datasets for holistic insights.
  - Transformer-based models (LMM, LOM) ensure accurate preprocessing.

- **Agentome**:
  - Advanced AI agents simulate personalized mental states and cognitive functions.
  - Supports downstream applications like clinical diagnostics and therapeutic recommendations.
